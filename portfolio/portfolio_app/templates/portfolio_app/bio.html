                <p>Structures and patterns of natural and programming languages have been my livelong passion. I still remember the thrill I felt solving the newspaper's cryptogram puzzle in my head as a little child, a fascination that came back when I took up Python during the pandemic. Yet, my desire to build bridges between people and cultures made me study French and Italian. After 6 years as a teacher in the French school system, I decided to take a sabbatical and work and live in Ireland. </p>

                <p>I got closer to technology by working for a Technical and Medical Assistance provider. Working the phone in four languages to get Swiss customers in emergency situation safely home, I also learned Html and CSS to help agents with a clickable decision trees for the browser-based softphone. Today, I'm responsible for optimizing, documenting and developing new features a phone system with 400+ users and 300 incoming lines. Whatever I do is focused on helping the customer, end-users and team-members.</p>

                <p>When I decided to transition to software development professionnaly in 2022, I was working full-time - a bootcamp was not an option. While online ressources are abondant, the Tech Community - local tech meetups, Women Who Code and Ladies of Code London have been crucial to my learning journey.
