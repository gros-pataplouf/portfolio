"Structures and patterns of natural and programming languages have been my "
"livelong passion. I still remember the thrill I felt solving the newspaper's "
"cryptogram puzzle in my head as a little child, a fascination that came back "
"when I took up Python during the pandemic. Yet, my desire to build bridges "
"between people and cultures made me study French and Italian. After 6 years "
"as a teacher in the French school system, I decided to take a sabbatical and "
"work and live in Ireland. When I came back from Ireland, going back to my "
"teaching career was not an option: there was so much more to learn and to "
"discover."
